    <p>Title: Quantum Computing</p>
    <p>Medium: Google Sites</p>
    <p>Process & Intention: My inspiration was to deliver a comprehensive and accessible resource explaining 
      fundamental aspects of Quantum Computing. Fueled by a curiosity and fascination with Quantum Computing, 
      I wanted to create a user-friendly platform and contribute to sharing knowledge in a field that holds 
      immense promise for the future. My aim was to provide a clear narrative on what quantum computers are, 
      delve into their historical development, and explore both potential risks and benefits associated with this 
      powerful technology. I envision this work as a stepping stone, sparking curiosity and encouraging further 
      exploration of the fascinating realm of quantum technology.</p>

    <p>Title: 4-Function Calculator</p>
    <p>Medium: JavaScript Graphics on CodeHS</p>
    <p>Process & Intention: My primary goal was to design a user-friendly and visually appealing 
      interface for performing basic calculations. I wanted users to have an intuitive experience, 
      allowing them to input numbers and operators with ease. I utilised functions to handle different
      aspects of the calculator, such as designing the graphical interface, checking whether a clicked 
      object is a number or an operation button, updating and clearing the displayed numbers, and performing 
      the actual calculations. What I learned from writing the code is the importance of modularity in coding. 
      Breaking down the functionality into smaller, manageable code, making it more readable, maintainable, and 
      easier to debug. I envision this work as a foundation for more advanced features and improvements. </p>

      <p>Medium: JavaScript Graphics on CodeHS</p>
      <p>Process & Intention: In developing this simple drawing program, my inspiration 
        stemmed from interactive drawing features commonly found in touch-based devices, 
        such as tablets and smartphones. The primary objective was to create a canvas that 
        provides users with an enjoyable intuitive drawing experience. I showcased my understanding 
        of event-driven programming, specifically utilising an event handler for mouse interaction/drag 
        events. I learned how to translate user interactions during mouse dragging events into 
        graphical responses and positions in the interface.</p>

      <p>Process & Intention: The purpose of the BMI Calculator program is to give a 
        quick and simple way to check whether weight is within a healthy range for height. 
        Research has shown that there is a strong correlation between BMI and risk of developing health conditions. 
        Developing the program gave me the ability to design a dynamic and responsive graphical interface and strengthened 
        my programming skills, like iteration, error handling, code optimization, an understanding 
        of algorithmic efficiency, handling data structures, management of user input, and implementation of calculations.</p>

    <!-- BeeHive -->

    <p>Title: BeeHive<p>
    <p> Medium: Arduino<p>
    <p> Process & Intention: Creating an advanced monitoring system for the school's beehives; 
      I specifically focused on developing a humidity measuring component and understanding the 
      functionality of a LCD screen to project these measurements. My responsibility extended 
      to deciphering the LCD, not just for my own task but for my classmates to recreate and project 
      their measurements efficiently, including tasks such as weight sensors. The ultimate goal was 
      to contribute to the well-being of the bee colonies, enhancing our understanding of hive conditions 
      and fostering sustainable hive management within the school community.<p>

<!-- Ancient Egypt -->

    <p>Title: Ancient Egypt Drawing</p>
    <p>Medium: Drawn on iPad Goodnotes 6</p>
    <p>Process & Intention: My inspiration for this piece is my culture and ethnicity.</p>
    <p>The scarab is a symbol of birth, life, death, and resurrection. The figure stands with 
      outspread wings supported by Cleopatra’s arms, a prevalent symbol in Egyptian art. The Sun 
      represented life, warmth, and growth. The Eye of Ra is a source of heat and light, associated 
      with fire and flames. The core of the split sun is held by the scarab to project onto the pyramid.
      I added stars since the Egyptians aligned the pyramids and temples toward the north since it 
      was believed the pharaohs became stars in the northern sky after passing. All design elements 
      combined are in the shape of the ‘Ankh’ known as “the key of life” representing union and life itself. <p>
    <p>My desired experience for anyone who views it is an appreciation for the cultural inspiration, and 
      to be awed by the beauty and symbolism embedded in the artwork. I hope the viewer gets a glimpse into 
      the world of ancient Egypt through my interpretation.<p>

      <p> Medium: Photoshop<p>
      <p> Process & Intention: In creating this project, I chose a pixelated style for the cactus images,
         giving it a unique digital aesthetic. The video features the cactus against different backgrounds – 
         clear day, serene sunset, starry night, etc... The intention is to blend elements of nature and digital art.
         The project, was inspired by the uprise of NFTs, it explores the concept of uniqueness in each iteration, 
         creating a dynamic and visually engaging experience.<p>

      <p>Title: Hubba Bubba x Fight Club<p>
      <p> Medium: Drawn on iPad Procreate<p>
      <p> Process & Intention: This project serves as a bridge between traditional and digital 
        art for me. By taking an old drawing and incorporating it into Procreate, I learned the 
        transformative powers of digital tools in artistic expression. This piece extended a traditional 
        artwork and brought new life into it. The process of completely changing the image to create 
        a more creative and colourful piece allowed me to experiment with digital techniques, 
        layering, and blending to achieve a unique visual outcome. In this piece, I pushed the boundaries by 
        combining two completely random things (Hubba Bubba x Fight Club); I see this leading me towards further 
        experimentation with unconventional creativity. In crafting this piece, my intention was to challenge a 
        thought-provoking response from the viewer.<p>

    <p>Title: Spirit, Mind, Body<p>
    <p> Medium: Canva, Procreate<p>
    <p> Process & Intention: For a business project we were tasked to create and sell a product in school for ‘Falcons souk’. I created a gym shirt (“pump-cover”) that promotes spirtuality; with the angel number 222 - associated with balance; the Arabic phrase “Everything happens for a reason” to connect culturally to the UAE; and an “F” on the shoulder for Falcon[s] (school mascot) to foster a sense of community. Designed for workouts, it serves a dual purpose of protection and motivation. All profits made through the selling of shirts were contributed to charity, adding a meaningful aspect to the project. <p>
    <p> -This was a collaborative project with 2 other classmates but I was the sole creator of all designs and logos- <p>
